# benchmarkx_gui

An attempt at creating a GUI for my [dart_benchmark_framework_x](https://github.com/winksaville/dart_benchmark_framework_x).

Currently this funtions on Linux, Windows, MacOSX, Android and iPhone.
It doesn't work on the web because Isolates are not yet supported
by on the [web platform](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/33577).
